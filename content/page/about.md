Hi! I'm Pedro, and I'm a mechatronics engineer. I love to code, so I work with
(and write about) software development.

In this website I'll be sharing some of my thoughts and notes in the form of
blog posts and quick gists. I also like making tools for myself, and I'll be
making some of those public too.

Besides programming, I also enjoy photography and motorsports. Unfortunately my
F1 career is looking somewhat less promising thus far, so I'll continue to focus
on the coding :)

If you'd like to get in touch, I'm reachable at pedrovhb@gmail.com or
[my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/pedrovhb).
